This app is developed in the memory of my close friend who committed suicide due to depression.

Human can recognized the emotions through different ways but this is how a system recognized emotions. Emotion plays an important role in social interaction and has strong connection with human body and brain signals. Emotion detection is a means of identifying distinct human emotion types such as furious, cheerful, or depressed.
According to recent studies, one in five college students suffers from some sort of recurring feelings of self-loathing and immense sadness. This may be the result of unhealthy amounts of stress and anxiety. This may also be the result of failing to fit into groups and not making friends. Plus, the slew of comparisons facilitated by the social media has only made this worse. Not only do college students compare themselves with others on the basis of their looks and physical appearance, but they compare social status and materialistic possessions as well. All of these have a severe effect on the mental health of students. If not kept in check, feelings of depression can become increasingly intense and can lead to suicidal thoughts. That is why I have developed the Happify Me for PCCE app.Students from my college will enter their state of thoughts and based on their emotions ,they are recommended to talk to people who are their well-wishers and share their grievances with them. Talking and sharing are not only ways to unload your mind, but they are also a form of self-therapy.

Process:

Student can enter what they feel.
Based on their sentence,the app can predict their emotions.
These emotions are then stored in a datbase and the frequency of negative emotions in any student will be evaluated by our college counselor.
If a student is sad infreuently then he/she can be given their favourite food to eat or music to listen.
But If a student is sad frequently then the counselor may ask her/him the cause of frequent sadness and advise ways to heal.
